## pygments for MediaWiki

This is a fork of [pygments-css](https://github.com/richleland/pygments-css) but intended for use on MediaWiki wikis. As the parent repo is released under the UNLICENSE, attribution is not required.

The difference from the original is that `.highlight` is replaced by `.mw-highlight`.

My recommendation is to use Monoaki for dark themes.
